# About *redux-counter*

This is a small exercise to discover Redux Toolkit by following an episode in [Learn With Jason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zySeP5vH9c) YouTube channel. It also made me discover [vite](https://vitejs.dev), an incredibly fast and lightweight alternative to create-react-app.

The app adds Redux over vite's default counter which uses ```useState```. I added some more reducers and buttons to make it a complete counter with increment, decrement, and reset.
